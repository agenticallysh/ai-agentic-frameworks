CrewAI is designed for orchestrating role-playing, autonomous AI agents. It enables agents to work together seamlessly, tackling complex tasks through collaborative intelligence.

## Key Features

- ü§ù **Multi-agent collaboration**: Agents work together as a crew
- üé≠ **Role-based agents**: Each agent has specific roles and responsibilities  
- üîÑ **Flexible workflows**: Sequential, hierarchical, and consensus processes
- üß† **Memory management**: Agents remember past interactions
- üõ†Ô∏è **Custom tools**: Easy integration of external tools and APIs

## When to Use CrewAI

‚úÖ **Best for:**
- Multi-agent systems where agents need to collaborate
- Complex workflows requiring different expertise
- Content creation and research tasks
- Business process automation

‚ùå **Not ideal for:**
- Simple single-agent tasks
- Real-time applications requiring low latency
- Highly performance-critical applications

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install crewai
```

### Basic Example

```python
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew

# Define agents
researcher = Agent(
    role='Researcher',
    goal='Research and analyze market trends',
    backstory='Expert market analyst with 10 years experience',
    verbose=True
)

writer = Agent(
    role='Writer',
    goal='Create engaging content based on research',
    backstory='Skilled content writer specializing in business topics',
    verbose=True
)

# Define tasks
research_task = Task(
    description='Research the latest AI trends in 2024',
    agent=researcher
)

writing_task = Task(
    description='Write a blog post about AI trends based on the research',
    agent=writer
)

# Create crew
crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher, writer],
    tasks=[research_task, writing_task],
    verbose=2
)

# Execute
result = crew.kickoff()
print(result)
```

## Examples

- [Basic Agent](./examples/basic-agent.py) - Simple single agent setup
- [Multi-Agent Team](./examples/multi-agent-team.py) - Collaborative agent workflow  
- [Production Ready](./examples/production-ready.py) - Full-featured production setup
- [Custom Tools](./examples/custom-tools.py) - Integrating external APIs
- [Memory Management](./examples/memory-example.py) - Using agent memory

## Benchmarks

[View detailed benchmarks ‚Üí](./benchmarks.md)

| Metric | CrewAI | Industry Average |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| Setup Time | 5 minutes | 15 minutes |
| Memory Usage | 512MB | 650MB |
| Token Efficiency | 85% | 70% |
| Collaboration Score | 9/10 | 6/10 |

## Migration Guides

- [From LangChain to CrewAI](../../migration-guides/langchain-to-crewai.md)
- [From AutoGen to CrewAI](../../migration-guides/autogen-to-crewai.md)

## Production Considerations

### Scaling
- Use process pools for CPU-intensive tasks
- Implement rate limiting for API calls
- Monitor memory usage with multiple agents

### Error Handling
```python
from crewai.exceptions import CrewException

try:
    result = crew.kickoff()
except CrewException as e:
    logger.error(f"Crew execution failed: {e}")
    # Implement fallback logic
```

### Cost Optimization
- Use cheaper models for simple tasks
- Implement caching for repeated queries
- Set token limits per agent
