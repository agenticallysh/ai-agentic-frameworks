# Contributing to AI Agent Frameworks

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Adding new framework examples
- Updating existing benchmarks
- Submitting migration guides
- Reporting framework updates
- Proposing new features

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, track issues and feature requests, and accept pull requests.

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

## Framework Addition Guidelines

When adding a new framework:

1. Create a directory under `frameworks/[framework-name]/`
2. Include:
   - `README.md` with framework overview
   - `examples/` directory with working code samples
   - `benchmarks.md` with performance data
   - Installation and setup instructions

## Code Examples Standards

- All examples should be runnable without modification
- Include clear comments explaining key concepts
- Provide both basic and advanced examples
- Test examples before submitting

## Migration Guide Standards

- Include side-by-side code comparisons
- Document breaking changes and workarounds
- Provide feature parity tables
- Include performance considerations

## Issue Reporting

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/agenticallysh/ai-agentic-frameworks/issues/new).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening)
